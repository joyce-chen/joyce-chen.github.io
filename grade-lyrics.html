Three birds fighting out in the yard But I don’t know what they’re fighting about So why does a dog need to listen Whenever you shout? These cats seem to blow Everyone’s mind, but mine What is so funny About beasts above understanding? [Instrumental Break] [Verse 2] Are you their master? Did you buy them at the store? Did they know they were a cure For you to stop being bored? So somebody mated them And took their babies away from them Stuck a price tag on their nose And now you’re buying it clothes [Outro] So, why does a dog need to be walked? [Intro] Who\'s with me? Who\'s with me? Who\'s with me? [Verse 1] Yeah, I\'m thinking about starting a corporation Who\'s with me? Nowadays, that\'s how you get adulation Who wants to start a corporation?

[Solo] [Verse 2] Yes, I\'m thinking about buying all the empty cots And making one giant army Who\'s with me? I\'m gonna buy up all the empty lots and make one giant farm Who\'s with me? (Woo!)

[Outro] And take it right to the top Take it right to the top! [Verse: Spoken Word] These are my demands I renounce wholeheartedly In this extreme abjuration That which I repudiate so vehemently Adamantly unrepentant Implacable and intractable I abdicate with inexorable pleasantry In this solemn refutation This most earnest repudiation I shall not negate That which I state irrevocably But I do it so gently That you cannot resent me For this humble request of my company So with time left permitting And while we\'re still sitting May I please have another cup of tea? [Verse] Every sound I hear Is louder than the last Sounds like a dynamite blast When you click your teeth I need relief Each one, each one Louder than the last and Makes my fingers curl Sounds like a dynamite blast [Chorus] Ain\'t no runnin\' Ain\'t no runnin\' When you\'re robbing a bank When you\'re robbing a bank Ain\'t no runnin\' Ain\'t no runnin\', ain\'t no runnin\' When you\'re robbing a bank When you\'re robbing a bank Ain\'t nowhere to run When you\'re robbing a bank When you\'re robbing a bank [Break] You sip your drink And I start to think That I\'m the only one That can hear all the sounds in the world [Chorus] Nowhere to run When you\'re robbing a bank When you\'re robbing a bank Ain\'t nowhere, ain\'t nowhere Nowhere to run When you\'re robbing a bank When you\'re robbing a bank Ain\'t nowhere, ain\'t nowhere Nowhere to run When you\'re robbing a bank When you\'re robbing a bank [Outro] Nowhere to run When you\'re robbing a bank [Verse] Hear me out, it ain\'t easy but I\'ll try to explain Everything in the world gets labeled and named A box, a rough definition, unavoidable Who picked the label doesn\'t want to be responsible Truth, you\'re the warden, here\'s the keys to the prison You create your own box, you don\'t have to listen To any of the label makers, printing your obituary Here\'s an example If Joe Blow says "Yo, you paint like Caravaggio" You\'ll respond "No, that\'s an insult, Joe; I live in a vacuum, I ain\'t coppin\' no one" Listen up, son Everyone creating is a member of the family Passing down genes and ideas in harmony The players and the cynics might be thinking it\'s odd But if you rewind the tape, we\'re all copying god Copying god, copying god Copying god, copying god Add your own piece, but the puzzle is god\'s Paying interest on the bills of late, but I just can\'t seem to remember the dates I lay low and turn off the lamps Come on over, you can lick the stamps and We could put together a portfolio and Sing hallelujah',
