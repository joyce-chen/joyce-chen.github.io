        		<h1>ABOUT</h1>
				<p>Joyce is a consumer (and sometimes creator) of all types of media from traditional pencil drawings to CADs to animation to comic books to video games...</p>
				<p>She is a low-key self-proclaimed guru of indie rogue-likes, but occasionally hypes about other triple-A titles such as Dark Souls (and Bloodborne).</p>
    				<p>Currently, she is in her sophomore year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), studying to be a EECS major (6-2) with a concentration in Comparative Media Studies (CMS).</p>
    				<p>In another part of her life, Joyce programs, designs, and builds cool things, but these contraptions have yet to been included on this website!</p>
    				<p>The only thing she likes more than sarcasm is writing about herself in the third person.</p>
