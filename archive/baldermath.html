        <blockquote>I have worked on numerous projects from the Teaching System Lab (TSL) and their partner foundation, the Woodrow Wilson Academy. I assisted the TSL in designing student-centered learning experiences. I worked on learning materials and games. This included: producing graphical and functional designs, visualizing instructional graphics, play-testing, conducting user-testing on potential users, and revising the materials accordingly.</blockquote>
          
      <h4>BalderMath - Instructions</h4>
      <blockquote>BalderMath teaches people not only to identify math mistakes, but to interpret the common  misunderstandings that would lead students to their mistake. During the different phases of play-testing BalderMath, testers had a problem understand the rules in the game. I created an instructional sheet to make the process of teaching the game smoother.</blockquote>
