her birth place Facin' the city, quotin' Biggie on all of the worst days I used to take the train with her so none of these lames give her the danger Livin' from where she was at was a plain picture I used to paint pictures on how we could gain riches together Instead of listen, she just kinda blew me off Paid it no mind, but it kind of just threw me off I guess I figured, everybody wants riches and the cars But she just wanted a better family because her parents divorced Early, her papa, he was taken by the force Mother on crack and she never had time to bathe her 'Stead she gave her to her uncle, her brother who played the saviour Until the day he started datin' this chick That had put him up on mad pills and fuckin' up mad bills She told me that one night he had got so fucked up He fell asleep on his sofa, then woke up a new persona And walked inside of her room and told her remove her clothing And forcefully started chokin' her and tellin' her not to move Before she could even finish, she rolled out in tears and did it Told me that for years, this night was a repetition, a feelin', a fear That she couldn't seem exit or quit it, the feeling was there Started talkin' lower and she told me come here She said she had to make choices So she got involved with niggas that make noise with them thangs, you feel Ran off in her uncle's spot with the stainless steel Put the burner to his face with this aim to kill And said, she don't fuck with niggas, 'cause niggas is the reason She got herself inside of this situation in the first place Figured this intimidation was the worst case She sat back and blew six in that boy face [Interlude] *gun shots* Shot, him, dead [Chorus: Tory Lanez] I want you, my dear No, I won't leave you lonely You hold your head up high I won't let go 'cause I can't leave you lonely Can't leave you lonely Can't leave you lonely Can't leave you lonely [Verse 2: Tory Lanez] He don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason He got himself inside of this situation in the first place He had no father figure He told me that his papa got shot in the face And he can't wait to find out who his killer He dedicated his life and now wants to know who had a motive to kill his only father He felt, it had to be somebody close It couldn't be somebody far away that didn't know 'im But take this part in When he was younger, he used to roll with his cousin The woman that used to show him the ropes She used to tell him, don't ever let no nigga or woman touch you And if somebody do, then all they would hear is the baka baka baka baka One day, he was on the block rollin' Then, this crack fiend woman came up to him and told him That she was his mother, man, that shit had him frozen He ain't want to believe her 'til she said, "Boy, you got a birthmark above your scrotum A scar up on your eye, came from when you was four, when you fell off in the road" At that point, he looked at her face and he froze She told him hold on, it's something she gotta show him She says to him, "I was gon' wait until you got older But something was on my mind, was pressin', I had to show you The whole block know me and the whole block know you The whole block been knew this story, but they ain't told you" His mom says to him, "I hope you know your pap was a good man But he just had some nonsense to him Huh, well, one night, he's fucked up on the pills I'm tryna tell him stop, but everything I'm sayin' fails You see, your lil' cousin in Brooklyn, where we would leave ya, uh I know she love you, but the story's more deeper Uh, you see, your father used to be a creeper He used to fuck her, used to touch her, used to beat her Used to leave her so confused she would lace her own coke and reefer Wait, I know you wanna interrupt but this get deeper You've been livin' this mission, you tryna figure who's the nigga Or the perpetrator of killin' your pops, nigga When your cousin is the reason, he got shot nigga She put six shots in him out the Glock, nigga" His anger was dwellin' all on his mind He didn't know what to do, he started grippin' his 9 And uh, before he knew it, he aimed it up at his mom And uh, *gun shots* he shot her right in his spine He said, "This is why, my life has been full of lies Don't nobody care for me, fuck it, what's the use in tryin'? This Glock on my side, if I put it to my mind I know that I'ma die, but in Heaven, I'd be alive" [Bridge: 50 Cent] Adrenaline pumpin', heart pacer racing, altercations, we lit Blood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip Lettin' off, somehow we end up in the same shit [Verse 3: 50 Cent] Stunt, get jumped on, slashed or dumped-on Same block you pump on is the spot you get slumped on Tory told me the story, it sounded a little crazy A little Nas, a little 2Pac, Brenda's havin' a baby How much pressure can you take 'fore you snap or break?
