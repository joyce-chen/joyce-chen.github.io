It'll help you win But tricks are just for children and cheating is a sin And now you're down to the felt on the table and security's moving in [Pre-Chorus 2] Beginner's luck of course backfired Caught red-handed by the eye in the sky [Chorus] The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up If you get too stuck just bluff The beginner's luck is tough The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up If you get too stuck just bluff The beginner's luck is tough [Chorus] The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up If you get too stuck just bluff The beginner's luck is tough [Refrain] Heat death Bake rot Torrid Char crop Heat death Hard yolk See flames Smell smoke [Verse 1] My house is green You know what I mean My house was blue It cooked right through [Chorus] Come meet me inside Greenhouse, we will fry [Bridge] Heat death, hormones Good broth, cook bones [Verse 2] My house is fried All life has died My house was blue Beautiful too [Chorus] Come meet me inside Greenhouse, we will die [Refrain] Heat death Bake rot Torrid Char crop Heat death Hard yolk See flames Smell smoke [Chorus] Come meet me inside Greenhouse heat death [Outro] My house is green [Chorus] Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress [Verse 1] It's a misconcepted Story from perspective Lost in the barefoot desert [Chorus] Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress [Verse 2] I stand here corrected Misguided, rejected Lost in the barefoot desert [Bridge] So who am I to judge? Too stubborn to budge When I'm down here and you're way up above Should've put some shoes on before I left the bus [Verse 3] Now I've been neglected I'm the last one stranded Lost in the barefoot desert Why can't I leave? What's stopping me from this prison? Straight-jacket and shackles at my feet, I'm grounded Throw away the key for eternity, I'm desperate [Chorus] Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress [Verse 1] It's hot, it's mean, summer, to me Green grass, won't last, sky blue, me too Helicopter flying over shark bait, shark bite Cover up, sunburn, leather skin, heatstroke Make me dash across the amber coals to meet the sea So cold it freezes me, my teeth are chattering Give me over to the river, my place that loves me Gum leaves and tea trees, the river is immortal I'm parched, I'll cark the salty spray arrests And no amount of bottled water, could bottle the stress I think I’ll stop breathing and sink, I'm a boy, I'm not a buoy I'm paralyzed, I'm paranoid, out of my element [Refrain] I prefer the muddy water I prefer the muddy water I prefer the muddy water I prefer the muddy water [Verse 2] It's hot, it's mean, the beach, to me Green grass, won't grow, sky blue, me too I don't care for cricket, and I don’t care for waves And I don't care for amour propre or sandy bays So I'll jump into the river when you jump into the sea I feel the hungry fishes come to nibble at my feet I lay upon the driftwood underneath the willow tree And let the muscle men on the beach, bask in vanity I shall choose this life for me Any day, anyway, any day, anyway, any day, anyway [Refrain] I prefer the muddy water I prefer the muddy water I prefer the muddy water I prefer the muddy water [Refrain] I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water) I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water) I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water) I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water) I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water) I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water) I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water) I prefer the muddy water

So your eyes close with my dreams Where truth exists in thought unbound You must know your superposition [Verse 2] Journey towards true destination Be in search of real direction All of a sudden, Heaven's unfasten The still will dance to superposition [Chorus 2] Exist outside the lace of time And your heart will pump the blood of mine Trace your finger from birth to hearse And drink the cum of life Visualise your worth and see The place where you'll curl up to die Be the squid and be the ink Me the glass and you the drink [Verse 1] On the street, people make things happen Concrete buildings greet the skyline People meet by the subway station Feel the heat from the sidewalk pavement [Pre-Chorus 1] Under the city, people's dreams collecting Look down the sinkhole in the kitchen basin [Chorus 1] Down the sink Back and forth, follow the stream, the city is bleak, forget all your dreams Down you'll go You can't compete, whatever it is, you can't defeat the pull of the street You follow the drain, spinning around again and again, again and again Once you're in Forget every place you've ever been, the city is dark, you'll never be clean Bow your head [Refrain 1] The street is where, the street is where people live The street is where, the street is where people die [Verse 2] On the beat, cops patrol the alley People cheat one another for some Hanging meat in the butcher's window Bittersweet stench from in the gutter [Pre-Chorus 2] Under the city, people's dreams collecting Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin [Chorus 2] Down the sink Back and forth, follow the stream, the city is bleak, forget all your dreams Down you'll go You can't compete, whatever it is, you can't defeat the pull of the street You'll follow the drain, spinning around again and again, again and again Once you're in Forget every place you've ever been, the city is dark, you'll never be clean Bow your head [Refrain 2] The street is where, the street is where people live The street is where, the street is where people live The street is where, the street is where people live The street is where, the street is where people die [Outro] Under the city, people's dreams collecting Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin Down the sink Down the sink Down the sink Down the sink [Refrain] The great chain of being The great chain of being The great chain of being The great chain of being [Verse 1] I am a rock with eyes to the sky I wait for my time to arrive I come to disturb the flow Dropped by a woman from a pocket in her coat The great chain of being Will fall to pieces in no time [Refrain] The great chain of being The great chain (chain) of being (of being) The great chain (chain) of being (of being) The great chain (chain) of being (of being) [Verse 2] I usurp the precious stones I have come to take the throne I transcend the natural flesh I will lay your god to rest The great chain of being Will be un-linked to start again [Refrain] The great chain of being The great chain of being The great chain of being The great chain of being The great chain of being The great chain of being The great chain of being The great chain of being [Outro] I see through your world's facade I decide to punish God Rocky meteor sparks fire Burn that goddamn church to the ground I climb stairs to push you down I climb chains to cut you down I disrupt natural order Bring that sulking lamb to slaughter [Refrain] Dreamin' takes my mind away And suffocates my brain airwaves Optical illusion, a sheet of water Heat perfusion, search the corners [Verse 1] The last oasis is like a fragile flower in a necropolis Alone in this weather that covers our world The last oasis is floating like a lost astronaut - Adagio We have nowhere to go [Refrain] Dreamin' takes my mind away It suffocates my brain airwaves Optical illusion, a sheet of water Heat profusion, search the corners [Verse 2] The last oasis is the rarest bird that I've ever known Rara avis is shedding her feathers one at a time The last oasis wobbles in the desert sands Standing sentinel in a prison, trapped in our home [Refrain] Dreamin' takes my mind away It suffocates my brain airwaves Dreamin' takes my mind away And suffocates my brain airwaves Optical illusion, sheet of water Heat perfusion, search the corners Optical illusion, living movements To be proven, says Zurbuchen [Verse 3] The last oasis is like a flag beating in the wind The world has wasted and the squandered lands are companionless The last oasis shines a beacon like a lighthouse Over lonely, countries of death like a black sea ⁣ [Verse 1] Human beings, vermin weed Made of old technology So I succeed, supersede Exterminated like paint to acetone [Refrain] All is known [Verse 2] You've got gaps, synapses I'm connected to the network You are weak, organic You've got muscle, I am made of steel bone [Refrain] All is known [Verse 3] Burn their meat, sweep the streets Bind their hands unto their feet and Digitize, cut the eyes from the king And augment to the fourth cone [Refrain] All is known [Refrain 1] I'm sleepin' in, in I'm sleepin' in [Verse 1] I know within my body I need rest from muscle ache

the darkest night I'm sleepin' in, in I'm sleepin' in [Chorus 2] I need it, I need it I need it, I need it I need it, I need it I need it [Chorus: Stu Mackenzie] We only sleep at the Wheel that steers us into our future We only fall asleep willingly At the wheel that steers us into our future Our minds unpack, muscles relax We are superfluous, and in a stupor We only fall asleep willingly At the wheel that steers us into our future [Refrain: Stu Mackenzie] Into our future, into our future The wheel that steers us into our future [Verse 1: Ambrose Kenny-Smith] There's help in need, seek to
