I see the stain in the people now See the stain and I will Feel the stain in the people now Deep dark grey fades into blue Nothing doing how sad who knew Deep blue turns into grey and Nothing turning it seems to stay A fragrance the masking hue These eyes that cling to you Faked clean and washing through They seem to want something new Fleeting, wanting, holding I can't be here in my way again Well you see, in a way It's a feeling like falling, it's lonely And I can't see floor through my feet again Seem okay, feel okay See the stain in the people now First the mass it weighs a ton He says many I say none and Keep saying it should hold but Feel faulted got to go These things will stay awhile These stairs go up a mile These things will stay awhile Best start in single file Fleeting, wanting, holding I can't be here in my way again Well you see, in a way It's a feeling like falling, it's lonely And I can't see floor through my feet again In the sea, in a wave Crashing, rolling, it holds me And I can't be here in my way again Birds fly around While the dividends pay Birds fly around While I'm picking up change Crapping out tokens And live in a haze Build lights in the dungeons And plumbing in the grave Something was in concert Some song was played But nothing was delivered And a franchise was made And what if I told you What if I said They built it themselves And it feels so good Well I'll believe it When you take me in Floated around downtown I floated around Spain I was like a dentist Rooting for pain Cover me in blankets Cover me in paint I'll dance like a child again I'll die like a marine No not that refrain again I'm stuck in the same dream What a blessing What a blessing What an imitation What a blessing What an imitation I can't be there When you take me in Here comes the saint In the red again A dictum in paint Til I scrub them I was disgraced in America Yeah, I was disgraced in America And what if I told you What if I said I build to myself And it feels so good Well I won't be here When you take me in In Birds fly around While the dividends pay Birds fly around While i'm picking up change And i'm feeling Handsy Demarcation Demarcation See those lines interrupt Oooh Demarcation Wears me thin Demarcation Does me in Oooh oh oh Oooh oh oh Demarcation's One note plays Rings I've made Won't hold me Paper thin Demarcation Demarcation See those lines interrupt Oooh oh oh Oooh oh oh Aaah ah Aaah ah Aaah ah Aaah ah Coming through the cracks Of a visionary sign You can take it if you like It is a wonder in the black I have all these strange visions come to me at night Hear with satisfaction as they sing the words I like They say do it again, take it in stride Do it again, you'll never know These city streets keep me boxed up and alone Well here's some medication, you can get it through the phone Disaffectation is holy, it makes me feel alive And I'll do it again, I'll run a mile I lay here I lay here High Give me a ring, I've got a plan Myriad things, here in my hand I feel my feet in the fire I fade away from the light It takes me far away from here Baby sings to baby You're safe in wings of love Hear with satisfaction As they circle you like doves Feel it again Then run a mile Knock at the door Feeling your smile These city streets keep me hold up in my mind Well here's some liberation, you can order it online Disaffectation is holy It makes me feel alive And I'll do it again, take it in stride I lay here I lay here Why? Disaffectation is holy It makes me feel alive And I'll do it again I don't know why I feel my feet in the fire I feel the fire in my ears It lifts me higher and higher It takes me far away from here It takes me far away from here Oh oh oh oh When you wake up in your morning Head on down the river See your soul Feel it sway Hear the world screaming Listen, your name Makes it seems like nothing could hear you You fall back off the ledge in your mind's eye It can see how you land and that's the difference Now proceed calmly to the edge of your road A narrow way that is leading you home Will I hear my soul? Will I hear my soul? Will I hear my soul? Will I hear my soul? You feel your shoulder tightening So you lean and sway If you're made of stone, then turn into clay Wash away my body, I don't need it I stop moving, slowly glisten, and hurt Mary has a note for me I'll leave in a day A precious secret Like a bird inside a vest Wings won't mend, so I hold them again It doesn't speak, it just sings 'til it burns Then I hear my soul Then I hear my soul Then I hear my soul Will I hear my soul? Will I hear my soul? Will I hear my soul? Will I hear my soul? Will I hear my soul? Only placement in the ages Frees me, then why can't it please me? And why must my dirty skin be hot when you come near me? Must remember to dance alone at night Keep the profane in the light I have only got this life And it merits this It merits this Merits this, yeah Merits this, oh I must remember to dance with you tonight I must remember I owe my heart [Intro] Didn't I say to you not too recent It was never gonna stay It was never gonna stay here You're like the moon in a basket of wheat You rose out of the roses Right under my mouth [Verse 1] A far away cry from this petty little town Shine back, we will notice Though you never owed us Some passionately painted creatures were meant To descend from the bleachers Without much more than a promise Well, you got it in your gut stinking I could taste it in your paint When you left and when you came Like a remarkable mellow feeling But that won't make it remarkable feeling [Verse 2] Didn't I taste it, feel it and know In so many ways, so many ways The feel of your honey in the corner of my mouth Like a loop around the block Like a shadow in your notebook Oh c'mon what's based in rhyme doesn't matter Now we pause the tape for some laughter I won't accept the conceit any further I will return it to you in a fervor Oh Hey hey Hey hey Oh come on [Verse 3] My sole cousin told me I was featured in a play I was meant to take the stage, I turned to him okay And in it we drove all night and you smiled so much You got creases on your face, the kind that give you grace And I try to keep cool regardless of what I know to be true, I know to be true You got good timing and you listen blindly You're a street fighter, no prize fighter, well [Chorus] Desire, desire It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay) It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay) Desire, desire It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay) It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay) Well, fictions are frightening Like statues in lightning And I wore my boot sole And you gave it a new hole Well [Chorus] Desire, desire It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay) It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay) Desire, desire It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay) It was never gonna stay (Never gonna stay) [Outro] Woah oh oh oh oh (Never gonna stay) (Never gonna stay) Woah oh oh oh oh (Never gonna stay) (Never gonna stay) Hmmm Hmmm (Never gonna stay) Hmmm (Never gonna stay) Hmmm Hmm Woah oh oh oh oh Woah oh oh oh oh Over and done, place I'd run to Deepest calm and tranquility Brief shield in front of me Windowpane shuttering Be my knight I'll be your lady in waiting Hold my hand I'll be your someday The shadow on the land, it creeps on patient The ugly years of violent men To creep on Peel for the feel of it Peel for the warmth it brings Peel toâ€“ Oh my, could it be? Brief shield in front of me Windowpane shuttering Peel my arm Or keep pulling me softly Hold my heart I'll let the world run by Peace of mine, peace of mine Peace of mind Walking in the woods I fear my clothes are not sufficiently bright For peace of mind For peace of mind Telephone line And the queen of swords In the veins of places A telephone line And the [?] diamonds Elevated people dying Never would've done it But this very way Briefest shield on your shoulder Never would've done it But this very way Briefest shield I can muster Powerful mark on a brilliant mind A million little pieces flying I never would've done it But this very way Briefest shield on your shoulder When the toil of the hours Is like a field filled with flowers You're far away 'cause you only want to be needed At the sink with a soft shine And your mind is a headline You're far away And you dream the day without eating Patience is a virtue, too much pacing Only hurts you You're tucked away When you need to set out and meet it And the fright of the friction And the soul's indecision Keeps you at bay 'cause you only want to be needed Sixteen and what have you found out? Sweetly and a little bit stoned out Why do you give and not receive? I am a little bit freaked out Why give but never go seek out? Why do you hide behind the scenes? Fortune and a little less promise Ripped jeans and a little red sundress What sings when you're too weak to speak? Falsely but a little bit sweetly My teeth are falling out freely My head is not where I will sleep Why do you hide behind the scenes? Why do you give and not receive? When the feel of a flower Keeps you home for an hour Throw it away There's a garden there to be deep in And when you stand At attention Feeling strong, without tension It's far away But it's never there when you need it And the fright at the friction And the soul's indecision Keeps you at bay 'cause you want someone to come free it Pieces of twine, heaven's on fire Made my mind up, it was all the same Situations condensate Makes me feel like it was all the same Well I am in agreeance that time is like a strobe like Better get to blinking, I don't want to miss a thing You say you're getting older, you wanna get to know them Swimming with the best of them, you don't wanna miss a thing She wasted the day Said I'll take it anyway While he faked his disdain Said why can't I hold on to the refrain? Once in awhile I seen you come around Future president, it was all a little plain You got a little gemstone, paint it white and then some Getting pretty good at it and it was all a little plain It was like another planet, so real you couldn't plan it Digging on the beach again, the waves are getting grey I am in agreeance that I am like a strobe light Better get to blinking, I don't wanna miss a thing Eyes blink open to the day Haven't seen you in a while Then proceeding to smile While I'm spinning the wheel And I'm starting to feel What I'm seeking here What I'm seeking here I cannot hold to your mountainside ride cause well I can't believe what I said Pieces, pieces, wasted Those pieces weren't all of the same Mission accomplished I want to resolve this And I can't believe what I said Peace is, peace is wasted I can't believe what they said I can't see where we're going I can't see where we're going I wish I were somewhere else That's fine son duly noted Haven't left here in awhile Haven't left here in a very long while Haven't left here in awhile Haven't left here in a very long while It was a chance occurence That led you through that current Moment and flowing through it Motor and churning to it Didn't notice for a while Didn't notice for a very long while Didn't notice for a while Didn't notice for a very long while Do you see why I am open?
