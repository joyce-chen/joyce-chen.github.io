[Verse 1] With weapons drawn we claim the future And then seep out through every storm Bring in the foe to be defeated To pulverize from dusk to dawn [Chorus] Firepower Petrifies Firepower [Verse 2] The die is cast, make no exceptions We're forged by evil to compel Come rally round this lack of freedom Our unions rise so go to hell [Chorus] Firepower Taking lives Firepower Neutralize [Verse 3] Empty the chamber Lock and reload This world thrives of danger It's bound to explode Aim for the target With laser and lights Releasing the trigger Puts victory in sight No time to pray or ask forgiveness Those blessed souls are now deceased There is no sense in this contrition With open arms we fight for peace [Chorus] We fight this firepower Petrifies Firepower Between the eyes Firepower Mortifies Firepower Man's demise I'll bring you the head of the demon I'm peeling the skin from his face The life that you lead is inhuman Its cause and effects a disgrace You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell Walking through fire, fate's in my hands Waiting for lightning to strike Man on a wire, bearing the brand Waiting for lightning to strike Lightning to strike Twisted dreams that are formed from illusion The collusion of fear and torment Decimating to stem this contusion With a power-mad freaking intent You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell Your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell Walking through fire, fate's in my hands Waiting for lightning to strike Man on a wire, bearing the brand Waiting for lightning to strike Lightning to strike I'll spin the world around reeling I have to when mankind's at stake I might be left broken and bleeding For it's all in the fight that we make You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell Walking through fire, fate's in my hands Waiting for lightning to strike Man on a wire, bearing the brand Waiting for lightning to strike Lightning to strike Lightning will strike! The devil's moved from Georgia His mission's still the same The world's become his oyster once again If you don't think you're worthy And you don't meet the cause He knows what's going on behind closed doors Beware there's voodoo in the night Evil never dies Evil never dies A master of deception Who takes you by the hand Then leads you to the palace of the damned He pulls the strings inside you And plays upon your fears Your final scream is music to his ears Beware there's voodoo in the night Evil never dies Evil never dies I'm caught up in the voodoo Trying to break free I feel I'm being smothered Trapped by this entity Blackened clouds surround me Filling me with dread I can't escape the horror With the devil in my head He relishes the suffering Can't stand this heart attack My life's been taken hostage And it's never coming back Beware there's voodoo in the night The devil's got you in his sight Evil never dies Evil never dies Evil never dies Evil never dies Like a cobra they will strike And like lions caged we'll fight We were taken not by choice They put anger in our voice We were fearless but so afraid Though in our hearts we still felt pain We're on fire but on a leash We only ever wanted peace Never the heroes, we were made to fight Never the heroes, we were just sacrificed at war Like a demon leads the youth We are terrible in truth No time to falter, no turning back When we come under attack There is no question as with a friend We have our honour to defend We're on fire but on a leash We only ever wanted peace Never the heroes, we were made to fight Never the heroes, we were just sacrificed at war At war We are together till the end We have our honour to defend Never the heroes, we were made to fight Never the heroes, we were just sacrificed Never the heroes (We were never the heroes) We were made to fight (We were made to fight) Never the heroes, we were sacrificed at war Born out of hell from the depths of Gomorrah Purging new graves and defiling the souls He satiates with such vile and dark horror Omens of dread on this night of the ghouls Raising the dead up from the ground Needs must be fed, sorcerers abound Necromancer Death's his guiding light Necromancer Stealing afterlife Feeding on flesh from the soil that was hallowed Splintered the bones and regaled in his feast Danced on the grave of the pure and the righteous As the moonlight's expelled from the eyes of the beast Raising the dead, blasphemy reigns Portents of dread thrives on remains Necromancer Feeding from the host Necromancer Black unholy ghost Necromancer Death's his guiding light Necromancer Stealing afterlife Raising the dead, cadaver consumed Sacraments said, bodies exhumed Necromancer Feeding from the host Necromancer Black unholy ghost Necromancer Death's his guiding light Necromancer Stealing afterlife Stealing afterlife Death's his guiding light Sunsets on the nations Worlds in her disguise Pray for all that matters Saviour in my eyes Children of the sun Dying one by one Eden has been wasted Deadly poison fills the air Kneel down in forgiveness While there's still time if you care Children of the sun Dying one by one Children of the sun Dying one by one I couldn't dream To be without her kind They wouldn't let her be Or heal what she defiled You are the hate that beats mankind Torturous lies that lead the blind Squandered the truth from all we said You are the reason I feel dead Mountains start to crumble Tumble in the sea Children of the sun Dying one by one Children of the sun Dying one by one Children of the sun Dying one by one Children of the sun Dying one by one Drawn from years of self denying Lost in chaos before the storm Our strength goes on prepared for mortal battle We can saddle our old scores Look to the skies and challenge all of heaven Resist the devil, dare to dream By grace of god within our hearts eternal For our salvation is for everyone We're standing as one We're carrying on Rising from ruins We're bringing the light Out from the night Rising from ruins We'll face our foes so they can hear our voices The land rejoices in empathy This trial by fire will build from their attrition It's ammunition for our enemies We're standing as one We're carrying on Rising from ruins We're bringing the light Out from the night Rising from ruins Send in the valiant, fight for what you believe Then we shall overcome, lay victory at our feet We're standing as one We're carrying on Rising from ruins We bring the light Out from the night Rising from ruins We're standing as one We're carrying on Rising from ruins We're bringing the light Out from the night Rising from ruins Look to the sky and face the sun You better try to race against the gun There's nothing left for you to prove You get a chance then now's the time to move Nothing to rival This heavy load Pray for survival End of the road You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower Sealing your fate, incinerate by the flame thrower No remedy so be afraid It's cutting deep just like the razor blade No escape, you're in a spell Don't you believe you stand a chance in hell Rays of redemption Fall from the sky Into the maelstrom Blink of an eye You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower Sealing your fate, annihilate by the flame thrower Immolate the bodies No one will be saved Consecrate with fire Ashes fill the grave Look to the sky and face the sun You better try to race against the gun There's no escape, you're in a spell Don't you believe you stand a chance in hell Nothing to rival This heavy load Pray for survival End of the road You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower Sealing your fate, terminate by the flame thrower Flame thrower Flame thrower Flame thrower Flame thrower In a league of his own A villain with no morals Above the law and reckless Mutating day by day Invisible and silence Conspiring to get power This man will stop at nothing To always get his way Like a thief in the night With the blade held tight Trapped inside the mind Of the spectre When you're mind in a vice He twists and turns with terror Keeps building up the pressure Until you're feeling numb Like a thief in the night With the blade held tight Trapped inside the mind Of the spectre Trapped inside the mind Of the spectre The spectre creeps behind you Shrouded by his stealth Ignore him at your peril He kills to heal himself In the blink of an eye He marks you with precision Corrupting all he touches Salvation in your soul Scourging you in silence As he makes his incision The venom's taking over This tyrant takes his toll Like a thief in the night With the blade held tight Trapped inside the mind Of the spectre You'll be frozen in fright Like the glint of his knife Trapped inside the mind Of the spectre The river shows no mercy The tower looms into my view I sense my execution's closing With darkness all around me The axe is ground to end my days The raven's cry proclaims repentance Out of the dark Into the light Leaving my mark Free from the traitors gate Into the storm I'm gonna win Killer of sin Saved by the traitors gate A man betrayed for treason I only wanted what was right To bring a purpose by rebellion The storm is soon arriving And rain will wash away my blood This walk of death will bring survival Out of the dark Into the light Leaving my mark Free from the traitors gate Ready to die Carry the day Bury the lie Tear down the traitors gate Forgive me for my sins I meant no harm to you So let the axe man fall To justify what I begin Where will you be tomorrow Now they've removed this mortal coil I hope and pray I bring you freedom For Honor, God and country This world can be a better place As I ascend from my conviction Out of the dark Into the light Leaving my mark Free from the traitors gate River of blood Turning the tide Cause of the flood Destroying the traitors gate Out of the dark Into the light Leaving my mark Free from the traitors gate Losing my head Blunt of the axe Alive when I'm dead Escape from the traitors gate You know that life isn't set I lead the pack I ain't no pretender You give as good as you get We live and die cause there's no surrender Chasing a dream as I go higher Playing it mean, my heart's on fire Living my life, ain't no pretender Ready to fight with no surrender You know the way that I feel If you're with me you better hold on tighter I'm only keeping it real That's who I am, I'm just a non-stop fighter Chasing a dream as I go higher Playing it mean, my heart's on fire Living my life, ain't no pretender Ready to fight with no surrender Run out of road The end of the days Not for the weak Only the brave Chasing a dream as I go higher Playing it mean, my heart's on fire Living my life, ain't no pretender Ready to fight with no surrender I'm chasing a dream as I go higher I'm playing it mean, my heart's on fire I'm living my life, ain't no pretender Ready to fight with no surrender Hey, I am the voice of your anger Hey, I am the voice of your pain Hey, I crave the feeling of danger Hey, I am the one with no name Out in the wilderness Out in the cold Out in the wilderness Lone wolf's calling Out in the wild, all on my own Leading me out of the cold Out in the wild, all on my own But leading me out of the cold They don't know the way that I'm feeling They don't know the depth of my rage I am like the wolf that is prowling Hey, I won't be found in a cage Out in the wilderness Out in the cold Out in the wilderness Lone wolf's calling Out in the wild, all on my own Leading me out of the cold Out in the wild, all on my own But leading me out of the cold Lone wolf walks beside me He feels no fear or pain Out in the wild, all on my own Leading me out of the cold Out in the wild, all on my own But leading me out of the cold Lone wolf walks beside me He feels no fear or pain Lone wolf is there to guide me From death to life again Now look and listen as you walk around And you'll hear voices on the wind Those lonely whispers from this hallowed ground Just take your time as they begin As the sun goes down The silence is profound For they gave so much So we might go on and live Laying peaceful they forgive In the sea of red There are stories to be told As the years go by All the memories unfold Bow your head In fields of wonder where those swallows soar Our hearts are weary as we pray The grass is greener from the tears that fall For you on this remembrance day Your message has been heard Words of wisdom have been shared Their despair won't matter as they rise above There is no end to love In the sea of red There are stories to be told As the years go by All the memories unfold Bow your head Sea of red From this earth take wing Shine down from the sky We see you as you fly In the sea of red There are stories to be told As the years go by All the memories unfold Bow your head Sea of red On the sea of red Where the glory has no end There's a place for us As our lives begin again Bow your head Sea of red
